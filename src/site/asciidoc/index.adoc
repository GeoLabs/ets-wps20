= WPS 2.0 Conformance Test Suite

== Scope

This executable test suite (ETS) verifies the conformance of the implementation
under test (IUT) with respect to the set of relevant specifications depicted in
Figure 1. Conformance testing is a kind of "black box" testing that examines the
externally visible characteristics or behaviors of the IUT while disregarding
any implementation details.

Several conformance classes are defined in the principal specifications; the ones
listed below are covered by this test suite:

* WPS Process Model Encoding (Conformance Class)
    - Including Process and data types XML Encoding conformance tests.
* Synchronous WPS (Conformance Class)
    - Including all conformance tests for synchronous execution.

== Test requirements

The documents listed below stipulate requirements that must be satisfied by a 
conforming implementation.

1. http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-065/14-065.html[WPS 2.0.2 Interface Standard Corrigendum 2]

If any of the following preconditions are not satisfied then all tests in the
suite will be marked as skipped.

1. Precondition. Verify that the server can handle echo process.

== Test suite structure

The test suite definition file (testng.xml) is located in the root package, 
`org.opengis.cite.wps20`. A conformance class corresponds to a &lt;test&gt; element, each
of which includes a set of test classes that contain the actual test methods. 
The general structure of the test suite is shown in Table 1.

The Javadoc documentation provides more detailed information about the test 
methods that constitute the suite.

== Using the REST API

Using the REST API of the TEAM Engine requires some run arguments. These ate summarized in Table 2.
The _Obligation_ descriptor can have the following values: M (mandatory), O (optional), or C (conditional).

|Description

|IUT
|URI
|M
|A URI that refers to the implementation under test or metadata about it. Ampersand ('&amp;') characters must be percent-encoded as '%26'.

|SERVICE_URL
|URI
|M
|A URI that refers to the implementation under test or metadata about it. Ampersand ('&amp;') characters must be percent-encoded as '%26'. Currently simply set this argument the same value with IUT.

|ECHO_PROCESS_ID
|A string value.
|M
|A string that refers to the echo process id implemented by the service.
